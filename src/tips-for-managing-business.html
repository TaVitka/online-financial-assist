          2. Separate Personal and Business Expenses: Keep personal and business finances separate by maintaining
          separate bank accounts and credit cards. This practice simplifies accounting, ensures accurate financial
          reporting, and makes it easier to identify deductible business expenses come tax time.

          4. Prioritize Expenses: Prioritize your business expenses based on their importance to your operations and
          profitability. Focus on essential expenses that directly contribute to revenue generation and consider cutting
          or reducing non-essential expenses that do not provide significant value.

          5. Negotiate with Vendors: Don't hesitate to negotiate with vendors for better pricing or payment terms. Many
          suppliers are willing to offer discounts, especially for bulk purchases or long-term contracts. Negotiating
          effectively can lead to significant cost savings for your business.

        <p class="article__text">
          6. Monitor Cash Flow: Keep a close eye on your cash flow to ensure you have enough funds to cover expenses and
          operate smoothly. Regularly review your cash flow statement to identify any cash flow gaps or surpluses and
          take proactive measures to address them.
        </p>

        <p class="article__text">
          7. Review and Analyze Expenses: Periodically review your business expenses to identify areas where you can cut
          costs or improve efficiency. Analyze spending patterns, identify outliers, and look for opportunities to
          streamline processes and reduce waste.
        </p>
