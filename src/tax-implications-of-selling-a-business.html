          Selling a business or exiting a partnership can have significant tax implications that business owners need to
          consider carefully. Here's a look at some key tax considerations when navigating these transactions:
        </p>

        <p class="article__text">
          1. Capital Gains Tax: When selling a business or exiting a partnership, any profit realized from the sale will
          typically be subject to capital gains tax. The tax rate on capital gains depends on how long the asset has
          been held, with long-term gains generally taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

        <p class="article__text">
          2. Basis Adjustment: The tax basis of the business or partnership interest may need to be adjusted to reflect
          any capital contributions, distributions, or changes in ownership over time. This adjustment can impact the
          amount of gain or loss recognized upon the sale or exit.

        <p class="article__text">
          3. Depreciation Recapture: If the business assets being sold include depreciable property, such as equipment
          or real estate, any depreciation claimed in previous years may be subject to recapture as ordinary income upon
          sale. Depreciation recapture rules can result in higher tax liabilities for the seller.

        <p class="article__text">
          4. Entity Structure: The tax implications of selling a business or exiting a partnership can vary depending on
          the entity structure. For example, selling shares of a corporation may result in different tax treatment than
          selling assets of a partnership or sole proprietorship. It's essential to consider the tax consequences of
          each entity type when planning for a sale or exit.

        <p class="article__text">
          5. Tax Deferral Strategies: Business owners may be able to utilize tax deferral strategies, such as
          installment sales or like-kind exchanges, to defer recognition of capital gains and reduce immediate tax
          liabilities. These strategies can provide flexibility in managing tax obligations over time.
        </p>

        <p class="article__text">
          6. Consultation with Tax Professionals: Given the complexity of tax implications associated with selling a
          business or exiting a partnership, it's advisable for business owners to seek guidance from tax professionals
          or financial advisors. Tax professionals can help navigate the intricacies of tax laws, maximize tax savings,
          and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements throughout the transaction process.
