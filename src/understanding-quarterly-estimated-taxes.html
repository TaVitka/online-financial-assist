          For self-employed individuals, managing taxes can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to estimating
          and paying taxes on a quarterly basis. Unlike traditional employees who have taxes withheld from their
          paychecks, self-employed individuals are responsible for calculating and paying their taxes throughout the
          year. This process, known as quarterly estimated taxes, ensures that taxes are paid in a timely manner and
          helps prevent a large tax bill at the end of the year.

          deductions and then determine their tax liability for each quarter. This can be done using IRS Form 1040-ES or
          through tax software programs. It's important to accurately estimate income and deductions to avoid
          underpayment penalties.
