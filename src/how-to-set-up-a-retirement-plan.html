          Setting up a retirement plan for your small business is crucial for ensuring financial security and attracting
          top talent. Here are six key steps to help you navigate the process effectively:
        </p>

        <p class="article__text">
          1. Evaluate Your Options: Research different retirement plan options available for small businesses, such as
          SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, 401(k), or Solo 401(k). Consider factors like contribution limits, administrative
          requirements, and employee eligibility criteria.

        <p class="article__text">
          2. Understand Employer Contributions: Determine whether you want to make employer contributions to your
          employees' retirement accounts. Employer contributions can be a valuable perk for attracting and retaining
          employees, but they also come with additional costs and administrative responsibilities.

          3. Consider Employee Needs: Take into account the needs and preferences of your employees when choosing a
          retirement plan. Consider factors like age, salary levels, and long-term financial goals to ensure the chosen
          plan meets their needs and expectations.

          resources to help them understand their options and make informed decisions about their retirement savings.
          Encourage participation and provide ongoing support to help employees maximize their retirement benefits.
