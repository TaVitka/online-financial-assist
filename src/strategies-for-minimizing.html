          One effective strategy is to maximize business deductions. Keep detailed records of all business-related
          expenses, such as supplies, equipment, and home office costs. By deducting these expenses from your income,
          you can lower your taxable income and reduce your tax bill.

          Another key tactic is to contribute to retirement accounts. Contributions to retirement plans like a SEP-IRA
          or Solo 401(k) are tax-deductible and can significantly reduce your taxable income. Plus, they help you save
          for the future while lowering your current tax burden.

          Consider structuring your business as an LLC or S corporation. These business structures offer tax advantages,
          such as allowing you to pay yourself a reasonable salary while taking additional income as distributions,
          which are not subject to self-employment tax. </p>

          It's also important to understand and take advantage of tax credits available to self-employed individuals.
          For example, the Qualified Business Income Deduction (QBI) allows eligible self-employed individuals to deduct
          up to 20% of their qualified business income.

          Lastly, consulting with a tax professional who specializes in self-employment taxes can provide valuable
          insights and help you identify additional tax-saving opportunities specific to your situation.

          By implementing these strategies, self-employed individuals can minimize their tax liability, maximize their
          savings, and achieve greater financial security.
