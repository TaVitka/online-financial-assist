          Tax planning is essential for freelancers and gig workers to ensure they maximize their earnings while
          minimizing their tax liabilities. Here are some practical tips for navigating the tax landscape:

          1. Track Expenses: Keep meticulous records of all business-related expenses, including equipment, supplies,
          and mileage. Deducting these expenses can significantly reduce taxable income.

        <p class="article__text">
          2. Stay Organized: Use accounting software or apps to track income and expenses throughout the year. This
          makes tax preparation easier and ensures you don't miss any deductible expenses.

          3. Know Your Deductions: Take advantage of deductions available to freelancers and gig workers, such as home
          office expenses, internet and phone bills, and health insurance premiums.

        <p class="article__text">
          4. Set Aside Money for Taxes: Since freelancers don't have taxes withheld from their paychecks, it's essential
          to set aside a portion of earnings for taxes. Aim to save at least 25-30% of income for taxes to avoid
          surprises at tax time.

        <p class="article__text">
          5. Contribute to Retirement Accounts: Consider contributing to retirement accounts like a SEP-IRA or Solo
          401(k). Not only does this help save for retirement, but it also reduces taxable income.
        </p>

        <p class="article__text">
          6. Understand Estimated Taxes: Freelancers are generally required to make quarterly estimated tax payments to
          the IRS. Familiarize yourself with the estimated tax process and make payments on time to avoid penalties.
        </p>

        <p class="article__text">
          7. Seek Professional Advice: Consulting with a tax professional who specializes in self-employment taxes can
          provide valuable guidance and help you navigate the complexities of tax law.
