        <p class="article__text">
          Follow Up with Phone Calls: If reminders don't yield results, follow up with phone calls to discuss the
          overdue payment directly. Maintain a professional and courteous tone while emphasizing the importance of
          timely payment.

        <p class="article__text">

          Implement Late Payment Fees: Clearly outline late payment fees in your invoicing terms and conditions.

        <p class="article__text">
          Escalate the Matter: If all attempts to collect payment fail, consider escalating the matter by involving a
          collections agency or pursuing legal action. Be sure to review the terms of your contract and consult with
          legal counsel if necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
          Maintain Communication: Throughout the process, maintain open communication with the client to keep them
          informed of the situation and any actions you're taking to resolve it. Transparency can help preserve the
          business relationship and encourage cooperation.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
          By implementing these strategies, businesses can improve their chances of collecting unpaid invoices and
          minimizing the impact of late payments on their cash flow and overall financial health.
